"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for RS_Stack.

Every case is an xfail for now: the Sedona Spark 1.9.1 release the suite pins
calls this function RS_Union, and the rename to RS_Stack (apache/sedona#3427)
is not released yet. The cases start passing once the pin moves to a release
that has RS_Stack; drop the module-level xfail then. (The refusal cases already
xpass, because Sedona Spark refuses the name it does not know.)

Each case compares the whole output raster, decoded on both engines, and
anchors it to the inputs' bands stacked in argument order under the first
raster's grid. The fixtures carry no nodata value: Sedona Spark's raster
transport is a GeoTIFF, which holds one nodata value per file, so it cannot
carry bands with different nodata values. Two known divergences are xfails of
their own: Sedona Spark casts every band to the first raster's pixel type where
SedonaDB keeps each band's own, and Sedona Spark ignores all but the first
raster's georeference where SedonaDB requires one grid.
