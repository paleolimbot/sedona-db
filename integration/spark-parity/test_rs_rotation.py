"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for RS_Rotation.

Both engines compute the angle of the grid's column-axis direction
`(scaleX, skewY)`: `acos(scaleX / hypot(scaleX, skewY))`, negated when
`skewY > 0`. (SedonaDB previously computed `atan2(-skewX, scaleX)`, which
agreed only while |skewX| == |skewY| and misreported rigid rotations of
non-square pixels; it was aligned to Sedona Spark's formula alongside
these tests.) Axis-aligned grids compare raw and exactly, including the
sign of the zero; the non-zero-angle queries compare through
ROUND(..., 12) — see the comment above the rigid tests for the measured
evidence forcing that.

# Why the non-zero-angle queries wrap RS_Rotation in ROUND(..., 12): neither
# runtime promises a bit-exact acos. Java's Math.acos is specified only to
# within 1 ulp of the correctly rounded result, and Rust's f64::acos delegates
# to the platform libm with no accuracy contract, so the exact double is an
# implementation detail that varies by platform and JDK. Measured on macOS
# (Rust libm vs Temurin 17), sweeping a rigid 2x3-pixel rotation over 72
# angles: 70 matched bit-for-bit and 2 differed by exactly 1 ulp
# (e.g. theta=-2.923 read 2.9234264970905017 vs ...13) — and pi/6 below is
# itself such an angle (-0.5235987755982988 vs ...87). Which angles are
# unlucky depends on the libm, so a raw comparison would be flaky across
# platforms rather than strict. ROUND to 12 digits collapses 1-ulp
# neighbours safely: each anchored constant's 12th-digit remainder sits
# thousands of ulps from a rounding boundary, so the engines cannot round
# to different values.
