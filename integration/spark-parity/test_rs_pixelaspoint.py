"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for RS_PixelAsPoint.

Both engines read the pixel coordinate 1-based, as PostGIS does — (1, 1)
answers the origin corner from both — so the in-grid cases anchor the
exact WKT. Out of the grid the engines part ways: SedonaDB extrapolates along
the geotransform where Sedona Spark raises, even though Sedona Spark's
own RS_PixelAsCentroid and RS_PixelAsPolygon extrapolate.

On a raster with a CRS the output point carries it (as SedonaDB's
item-level CRS and Sedona Spark's per-geometry SRID); `compare` reads
either per row and checks they agree, so the crs=EPSG:3857 case verifies
both the geometry and its CRS.
