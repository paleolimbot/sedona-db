"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for RS_WorldToRasterCoord.

The combined form returns the pixel coordinate as a POINT geometry;
results travel through the harness's geometry path (each engine's WKB
rendered as WKT by geoarrow) so the shared SQL stays RS-only. Every
case is a cataloged divergence: SedonaDB treats pixel coordinates as
0-based where Sedona Spark (following PostGIS, and SedonaDB's own
RS_PixelAs* functions) is 1-based (apache/sedona-db#1235) — and on a
fractional negative index the engines also disagree on rounding, so
outside the grid the answers are not even a uniform pixel apart. Both
engines also accept a point geometry in place of the (x, y) pair, and
that form carries the same 0- vs 1-based divergence.
