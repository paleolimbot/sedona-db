"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for RS_Resample.

SedonaDB's kernel deliberately mirrors Sedona Spark's positional overloads
(the 4-arg reference-raster form, the 5-arg `(widthOrScale, heightOrScale)`
form, and the 7-arg grid-snap form), so one SQL string drives both engines.
The nearest-neighbour path agrees bit-for-bit — dimension mode, scale mode
including the grown-extent border fill, the reference-raster and grid-snap
overloads — and those cases are anchored: nearest resampling on the standard
grid is hand-computable (integer upsampling is block replication, any regrid
picks the source pixel under each output pixel centre), so `expected=` states
the exact raster rather than trusting cross-engine agreement alone.

Interpolation is where the engines part ways. Sedona Spark really implements
only NearestNeighbor, Bilinear, and Bicubic, silently resampling with
NearestNeighbor for every other name it accepts (including SedonaDB's other
documented spellings Cubic, CubicSpline, Lanczos, Average, Mode — and unknown
names outright). SedonaDB runs a real kernel for all seven spellings and
rejects unknown names. Even where both engines really interpolate (Bilinear,
Bicubic) the kernels differ pixel-wise. All of that is `xfail`-cataloged, same
policy as the other suites: the reason states both engines' observed behavior,
and where one engine raises, that error is what trips the xfail.
