"""SedonaDB vs Sedona Spark parity for RS_PixelAsPolygon.

Both engines read the pixel coordinate 1-based, emit an identical ring
(clockwise from the pixel's upper-left corner), and — unlike
RS_PixelAsPoint — both extrapolate out-of-grid coordinates along the
geotransform, so every case anchors the exact WKT. On a raster with a
CRS the footprint carries it, and `compare` verifies that CRS agrees, so
the crs=EPSG:3857 case exercises both geometry and CRS.
