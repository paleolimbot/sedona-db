# These tests pin the exact rendered form of each expression. Locking the
# Display output is intentional: it doubles as a regression test on how user
# expressions appear in error messages and `repr()` output, and any DataFusion
# upgrade that changes the rendering should be reviewed deliberately rather
# than auto-passing. If you find yourself loosening these assertions, add a
# replacement check on `_impl.variant_name()` so the structural meaning is
# still locked.
