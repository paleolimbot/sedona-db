"""RS_MinConvexHull against a rasterio reference.

Each fixture is written to a GeoTIFF and read back through RS_FromPath. The
reference finds the data pixels with numpy and maps the outer corners of their
bounding cells through the file's affine transform. A skewed transform is in
the parameter set because skew is what separates mapping the four corners from
taking a world-space bounding box. The transforms and cell indices are small
dyadic values, so both sides compute every coordinate exactly and compare with
`==`.
