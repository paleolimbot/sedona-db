            aggfunc: How to aggregate the remaining non-geometry columns.
                Only `"first"` is currently supported.

        Returns:
            A `GeoDataFrame` with one row per group. Unlike GeoPandas, the group
            keys stay ordinary columns rather than becoming the index.

        Three remaining differences from GeoPandas:

        - `aggfunc="first"` is an unordered aggregate: it returns *some* value from
          the group, not necessarily the one from the first row, and it does not
          skip missing values the way GeoPandas' `first` does. A group containing a
          null or NaN may therefore aggregate to that value.
        - Dissolving an empty frame with `by=None` yields one row — empty geometry
          collection, null attribute values — rather than zero rows, because that
          is what a grouping-free SQL aggregate returns. Detecting emptiness would
          require executing the query first.
        - A group mixing 2D and 3D geometries raises, because the collect step
          rejects mixed coordinate dimensions; GeoPandas promotes to 3D with NaN.
          Normalize the dimension first if a group can contain both.
        - Grouping is observed-only: a categorical key contributes one group per
          value actually present. GeoPandas defaults to `observed=False` and also
          emits empty groups for unused categories, but the category domain does
          not survive a relational aggregation, so those groups cannot be
          reconstructed here.
