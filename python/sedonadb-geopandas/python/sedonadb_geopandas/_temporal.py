"""Temporal (duration and timestamp) compatibility with numpy-backed pandas.

Everything temporal lives here rather than in the general scalar and frame
helpers, because temporal values need handling nothing else does:

- numpy-backed pandas stores NaT as INT64_MIN ticks — a representable Arrow
  value — so data arriving through Arrow can carry the missing-value sentinel
  as real data, and it must become SQL null before any operator sees it.
- NumPy temporal units span attoseconds to years while Arrow holds s/ms/us/ns;
  conversions pick a lossless unit and reject or overflow-check the rest, and
  pandas scalars resolve to microsecond literals that silently truncate
  nanoseconds unless routed through their numpy form.
- Duration arithmetic runs on int64 ticks, so overflow, precision, and
  division edge cases (by zero, by infinity) need pandas' answers rebuilt on
  relational expressions that cannot raise for individual rows.
