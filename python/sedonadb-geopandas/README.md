# sedonadb-geopandas

A GeoPandas-compatible API on top of [SedonaDB](https://sedona.apache.org/sedonadb/).

The goal is to let existing GeoPandas code run against SedonaDB's relational
engine with minimal changes, by providing `GeoDataFrame` / `GeoSeries` wrappers
whose methods mirror GeoPandas but delegate to SedonaDB expressions.

```python
import geopandas
import sedonadb_geopandas as sgpd

gdf = sgpd.from_geopandas(geopandas.read_file("cities.geojson"))
big = gdf[gdf["pop"] > 1_000_000]          # boolean-mask filter
gdf["surveyed"] = True                     # broadcast a scalar column
gdf["centers"] = gdf.geometry.centroid     # assign a computed column
web = gdf.to_crs("EPSG:3857")              # reproject (CRS tracked through)

zones = gdf.dissolve(by="region")          # group and union geometry

result = zones.to_geopandas()               # back to a real GeoDataFrame
```

## Intentional differences from GeoPandas

This is a compatibility layer over a lazy, relational engine, so it is
deliberately *not* identical to GeoPandas:

- **Lazy, not eager**: operations build a query; data materializes on
  `to_geopandas()` / `to_pandas()` / display.
- **No row index / alignment**: there is no pandas `Index`; joins and filters
  are positional/relational, not index-aligned. Consequently `dissolve()`
  leaves the group keys as ordinary columns instead of moving them into the
  index.
- **Immutable under the hood**: "in-place" style operations return a new frame.
  A `Series` read from a frame stays usable across assignments that only *add*
  columns (so `g = gdf.geometry` can supply `g.area`, `g.length`, ... in turn),
  but replacing a column or filtering rebinds the frame, and a `Series` read
  before that is stale and raises rather than silently resolving to different
  values.
- **Columns cannot be mixed across frames**: without row alignment, combining
  columns from two different frames raises rather than guessing. Join first.
- **Plotting and arbitrary `apply`**: use the `to_geopandas()` escape hatch and
  operate on the materialized result.
- **Assignment takes a column or a scalar, not a bare expression**: a SedonaDB
  expression records no origin, so one built from another frame would resolve
  against the destination and silently write the wrong values. Assign a `Series`
  read from the same frame, or a scalar (a geometry included). For anything the
  wrapper does not cover, drop to the SedonaDB `DataFrame` API directly.

`dissolve()` aggregates non-geometry columns with `"first"`, which is an
unordered aggregate: it returns *some* value from the group rather than the one
from the first row, and unlike GeoPandas it does not skip missing values, so a
group containing a null or NaN may aggregate to that. Dissolving an empty frame
without a group key returns one row — empty geometry collection, null attribute
values — rather than zero rows, because that is what a grouping-free SQL
aggregate produces, and a group mixing 2D and 3D geometries raises rather than
being promoted to 3D. Grouping is observed-only: unused categories of a
categorical key do not produce empty groups the way GeoPandas' default
`observed=False` does, because the category domain does not survive a relational
aggregation.

See the SedonaDB "Migrating from GeoPandas" guide for the relational model that
underlies each method.
