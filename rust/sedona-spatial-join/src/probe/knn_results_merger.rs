/// [UnprocessedKNNResultBatch] represents the KNN results produced by probing the spatial index.
/// An [UnprocessedKNNResultBatch] may include KNN results for multiple probe rows.
///
/// The KNN results are stored in a StructArray, where each row corresponds to a KNN result.
/// The results for the same probe row are stored in contiguous rows, and the offsets to
/// split the results into groups per probe row are stored in the `offsets` field.
///
/// Each probe row has a unique index. The index must be strictly increasing
/// across probe rows. The sequence of index across the entire sequence of ingested
/// [UnprocessedKNNResultBatch] must also be strictly increasing. The index is computed based on
/// the 0-based index of the probe row in this probe partition.
///
/// The KNN results are filtered, meaning that the original KNN results obtained by probing
/// the spatial index may be further filtered based on some predicates. The predicates here can be
/// any predicate, such as L.id = R.id when the KNN join contains an equi-condition. It is also possible
/// that all the KNN results for a probe row are filtered out. However, we still need to keep track of
/// the distances of unfiltered results to correctly compute the top-K distances before filtering. This
/// is critical for correctly merging KNN results from multiple partitions.
///
/// Imagine that a KNN query for a probe row yields the following 5 results (K = 5):
///
/// ```text
/// D0  D1  D2  D3  D4
/// R0      R2  R3
/// ```
///
/// Where Di is the distance of the i-th nearest neighbor, and Ri is the result row index.
/// R1 and R4 are filtered out based on some predicate, so the final results only contain R0, R2, and R3.
/// The core idea is that the filtering is applied AFTER determining the top-K distances, so the number
/// of final results may be less than K.
///
/// However, if we split the object side of KNN join into 2 partitions, and the KNN results from
/// each partition are as follows:
///
/// ```text
/// Partition 0:
/// D1  D3  D5  D6  D7
///     R3      R6  R7
///
/// Partition 1:
/// D0  D2  D4  D8  D9
/// R0  R2      R8
/// ```
///
/// If we blindly merge the filtered results from both partitions and take top-k, we would get:
///
/// ```text
/// D0  D2  D3  D6  D8
/// R0  R2  R3  R6  R8
/// ```
///
/// Which contains more results than single-partitioned KNN join (i.e., 5 results instead of 3). This is
/// incorrect.
///
/// When merging the results from both partitions, we need to consider the distances of all unfiltered
/// results to correctly determine the top-K distances before filtering. In this case, the top-5 distances
/// are D0, D1, D2, D3, and D4. We take D4 as the distance threshold to filter merged results. After filtering,
/// we still get R0, R2, and R3 as the final results.
///
/// Please note that the KNN results for the last probe row in this array may be incomplete,
/// this is due to batch slicing during probe result batch production. We should be cautious
/// and correctly handle the KNN results for each probe row across multiple slices.
///
/// Here is a concrete example: the [UnprocessedKNNResultBatch] may contain KNN results for 3 probe rows:
///
/// ```text
/// [P0, R00]
/// [P0, R01]
/// [P0, R02]
/// [P1, R10]
/// [P1, R11]
/// [P1, R12]
/// [P2, R20]
/// ```
///
/// Where Pi is the i-th probe row, and Rij is the j-th KNN result for probe row Pi.
/// The KNN results for probe row P2 could be incomplete, and the next ingested KNN result batch
/// may contain more results for probe row P2:
///
/// ```text
/// [P2, R21]
/// [P2, R22]
/// [P3, R30]
/// ...
/// ```
///
/// In practice, we process the KNN results or a probe row only when we have seen all its results.
/// The may-be incomplete tail part of an ingested [UnprocessedKNNResultBatch] is sliced and concatenated with
/// the next ingested [UnprocessedKNNResultBatch] to form a complete set of KNN results for that probe row.
/// This slicing and concatenating won't happen frequently in practice (once per ingested batch
/// on average), so the performance impact is minimal.
